Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team. In practice, that means you’ll have the support you need to get your work done, but you’ll also have to be familiar with the whole code base and all of our products and services. Our team is business-minded, so everyone has good working knowledge about the company, fundraising, and the insurance industry. The dev team is also cross-functional, so you’ll work with our insurance experts, quality assurance, product team, and operations very closely.

We’re very product-focused and don’t let tech fads get in the way of shipping new features—but we also value clean code, automated testing, and other sustainable practices.

In short: we move fast, are excited about the work we do, and don’t let non-essentials get in the way of building great products.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

As a senior engineer, you'll have the ability to mentor and train less experienced engineers as well as assist with design and architecture decisions. We're a low ego team, you won't have full control over these decisions but we expect you to use your expertise to suggest solutions to difficult problems.
A Day in the Life May Include:
Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Ruby on Rails (with some Javascript and Python)
Collaborating with various members of the development team to complete multiple projects. We’re a startup, so we’ll keep you busy

Why Cisco:

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

You make the most comfortable socks in the history of feet. Millions of pairs sold and donated later, Bombas is continuing to innovate with new socks and apparel while creating a positive impact on the community where we all work and live.

About Bombas:


Bombas is a comfort focused apparel brand with a mission to help those in need. The company launched in 2013, after the founders learned that socks are the #1 most requested clothing item at homeless shelters. From there, they set out to solve that problem, donating a pair of socks for every pair they sell. How do you donate a lot of socks? You sell a lot. And how do you sell a lot? You make the most comfortable socks in the history of feet. Millions of pairs sold and donated later, Bombas is continuing to innovate with new socks and apparel while creating a positive impact on the community where we all work and live.

At Bombas, comfort is heavily rooted in our DNA.

Using React and Bootstrap you create an interface for subject matter experts to control our automated feature engineering algorithm from our web app. To get this done, you collaborate with our backend developers (who use Django) to design a new API to expose the endpoints you need to build it.
Using big data technologies like Spark or Dask you replicate our existing API, so we can scale out our data processing to extremely large datasets without disrupting users.
Using Docker containers, you make it as easy to deploy Feature Labs on-premise for a large enterprise customer as it is for use to deploy to Amazon Web Services.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

Minimum Requirements:


DoD SECRET Clearance
CompTIA Security+
10 years of experience and a BA/BS or MA/MS degree
Preferred Requirements:
Experience in:
Risk Management Framework (RMF) accreditation process
Enterprise application management
Software development change management.

143,.NET Software Engineer,$50K-$149K (Glassdoor est.),"About You and Position Summary:

You’ve worked on large-scale enterprise systems and have come to realize there’s a better way to develop software—a platform of small, focused systems that each serve a specialized purpose and that can be delivered quickly. You’ve worked as both a developer and a consumer of enough APIs to have formed opinions on what makes an API useful and intuitive. You think in REST, know more about “HATEOAS” than how to spell it, and when it comes to message queues, you understand the implications of “at least once message delivery.” You might even be up to the challenge of naming things. Working with more junior developers gets you excited for the coaching opportunities, and more senior developers for the learning. Groking the business requirements is second-nature. You own what you wrote and jump in to help your team support the product when there’s a fire, and when the smoke clears you’re one of the first to say “ok, how can we make sure that doesn’t happen again?” You’re passionate and opinionated about great software; and most importantly, you love building real, working apps that surprise and delight your customers.

144,.NET Software Engineer,$50K-$149K (Glassdoor est.),"About You and Position Summary:

You’ve worked on large-scale enterprise systems and have come to realize there’s a better way to develop software—a platform of small, focused systems that each serve a specialized purpose and that can be delivered quickly. You’ve worked as both a developer and a consumer of enough APIs to have formed opinions on what makes an API useful and intuitive. You think in REST, know more about “HATEOAS” than how to spell it, and when it comes to message queues, you understand the implications of “at least once message delivery.” You might even be up to the challenge of naming things. Working with more junior developers gets you excited for the coaching opportunities, and more senior developers for the learning. Groking the business requirements is second-nature. You own what you wrote and jump in to help your team support the product when there’s a fire, and when the smoke clears you’re one of the first to say “ok, how can we make sure that doesn’t happen again?” You’re passionate and opinionated about great software; and most importantly, you love building real, working apps that surprise and delight your customers.

Description
Framebridge is a fast-growing company that is revolutionizing the $4 billion custom framing industry. Existing custom framing options are time-consuming, complex, and expensive; many people never get around to custom framing their favorite art or photos at all. We are changing all that with a curated and streamlined process along with modernized tech and manufacturing.

We make it simple and affordable to custom frame the things you love.


The problems we solve on the engineering team span eCommerce, manufacturing, logistics, and data analysis. We strive to create unique and intuitive experiences that allow customers to frame their art using powerful and easy-to-use products. We also create the tools, systems, and processes to empower our own employees in constructing great frames and an experience that customers love.

We work on continuously delivering products and iterative improvements. Along the way we keep learning and growing as a team and individuals, prototyping and experimenting to expand our capabilities. As part of a small company, each member of our team has opportunities for leadership and guiding the evolution of products we create.

Technology is key to improving custom framing.

The focus of eCommerce vs Manufacturing will be based on the candidate's experience and team fit. This candidate can be based out of either our DC Georgetown office or our Richmond, KY manufacturing facility.

Example eCommerce projects for the team include developing streamlined frame design processes for customers, modeling new merchandise options like mat captions, and building off-site purchase integration with Instagram. Manufacturing work projects bridge eCommerce and Retail into the world of manufacturing frames, such as inventory transfers between facilities, integrating with new CNC and Laser etching machines, and facility-capability directed manufacturing work scheduling.
Desired Traits
8+ years overall professional experience in a collaborative team setting
Experience leading an agile team, supervising developers and helping them grow through direct mentorship and management
Experience architecting Ruby/Rails projects
Experience with eCommerce platforms such as Spree, Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce

More about Apptegy

Apptegys mission is to help school leaders share the story of every student. Amazing moments are happening in school districts, but those moments rarely become stories that reach the community. Our products empower school leaders and educators to share those stories and run better schools.

Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Last year at Eventbrite organizers created 3 million events and we processed 150 million tickets. Behind all of those tickets and events is a number of teams working together to keep our product scalable and available as we grow. Our goal is to be the global platform for live experiences.
THE TEAM
We're a people-focused Engineering organization: the women and men on our team value working together in small teams to solve big problems, supporting an active culture of mentorship and inclusion, and committing themselves to learn new things daily. Pair programming, weekly demos, tech talks, and quarterly hackathons are at the core of how we’ve built our team and product. We believe in engaging with the community, regularly hosting free events with some of the top technical speakers, and actively contributing to open-source software (check out Britecharts as an example!).

THE SKILL SET
4+ years building applications in a mainstream programming language: Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, C++, Java, etc.
2+ years of experience using some form of web framework: Django, Symphony, Rails, ASP.net, etc.
4+ years of experience using a SQL database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc
Efficient, practical programmer with a record of designing and producing dependable code
You care about making sure your code is maintainable and well tested
You bring knowledge of TDD and do it in your day to day
A result driven self starter with great communication and collaboration skills, we put a lot of emphasis on being team players
Passion to learn and to teach/mentor others
BONUS POINTS
You have knowledge of microservices and/or Service Oriented Architecture
You have experience working with modern frontend frameworks: React, Backbone/Marionette, etc
You have experience designing and developing APIs, both internal service and HTTP APIs
ABOUT EVENTBRITE
Eventbrite is a global ticketing and event technology platform, powering millions of live experiences each year. We empower creators of events of all shapes and sizes – from music festivals, experiential yoga, political rallies to gaming competitions –– by providing them the tools and resources they need to seamlessly plan, promote, and produce live experiences around the world. Last year, the team served 795,000 creators hosting nearly 4 million experiences across 170 countries. Meet some of the Britelings that make it happen.

511,Software Engineer,$43K-$72K (Glassdoor est.),"At Kin, we’re looking for self-motivated thinkers ready to make a change for our customers. We value tackling challenges and breaking down walls – but being chill about it.

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team. In practice, that means you’ll have the support you need to get your work done, but you’ll also have to be familiar with the whole code base and all of our products and services. Our team is business-minded, so everyone has good working knowledge about the company, fundraising, and the insurance industry. The dev team is also cross-functional, so you’ll work with our insurance experts, quality assurance, product team, and operations very closely.

We’re very product-focused and don’t let tech fads get in the way of shipping new features—but we also value clean code, automated testing, and other sustainable practices.

In short: we move fast, are excited about the work we do, and don’t let non-essentials get in the way of building great products.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

As a senior engineer, you'll have the ability to mentor and train less experienced engineers as well as assist with design and architecture decisions. We're a low ego team, you won't have full control over these decisions but we expect you to use your expertise to suggest solutions to difficult problems.
A Day in the Life May Include:
Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Ruby on Rails (with some Javascript and Python)

Overview:


Two Barrels is hiring a Ruby on Rails Software Engineers for $110,000/year plus a $10,000 hiring bonus. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.

This particular job is for Ruby experience, but we understand that ROR or a flavor of Ruby isn’t super common locally. If you have solid software engineering experience in a different language, we have a solid path to this mid level software engineer role by coming on board as a JR ROR Software Engineer and working together to monitor how quickly you get up to speed on Ruby with the intent of moving you to this Mid Level Ruby on Rails Software Engineer role when you become proficient in ROR.

About the Job:

At Two Barrels you will work with a close-knit group of engineers who come from a diverse mix of backgrounds and experiences. We build out new exciting Rails projects, maintain and refactor older Rack based ones built in POR. We are constantly evolving, growing and willing to try new technologies and techniques, as long as we meet the businesses needs.

We want someone who is eager to learn and help others but can also take on a project independently and be just fine. Our team supports each other and understands not everyone is the same – some of us are great at CI/CD development, some of us are wizards at SQL, and others just love Plain Old Ruby – meaning although we expect you to work the full-stack we also understand if you prefer to work in one area more than the other.

How to Apply:

Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do. We will do an initial phone interview, a video call with a small group of our team, and then if everyone is still liking things, typically we’d have you come in and meet everyone, but with Covid we’re doing group video calls right now while we’re all working remote.

Wage:

$110,000/year
*$10,000 hiring bonus**
Responsibilities:
Be a good human
Treat your co-workers with respect
Have a Growth Mindset, not a Fixed Mindset
Help us consistently release high end software
Monitors and ensures automated processes run as expected
Help design and build novel systems from scratch
Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor's Degree in related field or related work experience
3+ years professional experience with full stack application development
Intimately familiar with Rails and Ruby
Experience with front-end web development, HTML, CSS, Javascript
You find satisfaction in a job well done and want to solve hard problems
You have 10 fingers or can type the equivalent speed of a 10 fingered person
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with designing, building, and maintaining efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code
Strong grasp of security principles and how they apply to e-commerce applications
Experience in planning and delivering software
Able to work in an agile environment with a focus on continuous integration
Comfortable with using Docker
Comfortable working with Vue
General understanding of AWS and the services within: ECS, EC2, S3, and RDS
You bring some weird or quirky new aspect of living and humanity to our workforce
Parrot whisperer
Why you might like this job:


You’ve been building large rails apps for other companies. The ones with carrots dangling in front of you, hipster benefits, slippery ladders, and always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software. You like the idea of working for a locally owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like it that your work matters today and will affect millions of business customers of ours.

You like the idea that you could find a place like this in Spokane, where we have 4 seasons, you can buy a great house for a great price and if you have to commute longer than 20 minutes here, people would probably move or not work there. You like it that there’s 5 ski hills within 2 hours. Endless outdoor activities, and people who are here don’t want you bragging about it to cool actual tech cities. You don’t like bugs or humidity or a million people living in your city.

You love to code, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was ok or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because ok or good isn’t fulfilling to you.

But… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3 depending on if you have religion in your life. Our goal is to use the incredible business we’ve been blessed to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life and then we think we’ll have more fun working together during the day, if we know there’s a clear cut off and can create a work environment where we can not only go home, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. There’s no hipster saving or changing the world bs mission statement here. We try to make it a non-hostile job that pays well and doesn’t stress you out so you can call it a day and go have fun personally.

Benefits:

Great Wage
18 days paid time off
4 paid holidays off of your choosing
3% retirement matching through a Fidelity Simple IRA
100% employer-paid medical, dental and vision for employees

You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience as a site reliability engineer (or equivalent). Must understand things like caching, web scraping, exponential backoff, serverless, and rate limiting.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices a must!
Experience working with serverless functions.
Experience with application metrics using StatsD/Prometheus/etc.
Experience managing on-call rotations and responding to support incidents.

Why Cisco:

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

This is a role within Cisco's Intent Based Business team. Here, you will work on developing the Nexus 9000 line of data center that features application awareness to make the network infrastructure flexible and agile for dynamic response to application needs and virtual machine workload mobility.

Who You'll Work With


You will have the opportunity to work with some of the brightest problem solvers in the Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Team that work on next generation of datacenter and cloud switches.

https://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/cisco-fulfills-vision-for-aci-anywhere
Who You Are


You are someone who thrives in a dynamic start-up like environment. You have at least 3-5+ years of software engineering experience and are looking for an opportunity to shine, a team where you can thrive, one that recognizes your capabilities and rewards you accordingly.
You have experience in software development with Golang and Java.
Experience working with Kafka streaming.
You have designed and developed distributed systems, API, workflow, concurrency, multithreading, and synchronization.
You have foundation in data structures, algorithms and software design with strong analytical and debugging skills.
Proficiency in object-oriented programming.
Programming/scripting in one or many languages. We use Java, and Golang, but we’re always looking for new and improved options.
Good understanding of containerization and virtualization.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

A market-leading, global tech company that equips legal professionals with a powerful platform to organize data, discover the truth, and act on it.  The US Department of Justice, 198 of top 200 US law firms, and more than 70 Fortune 100 companies are among the customers who trust Relativity during litigation, internal investigations, and compliance projects.
Our SaaS product, RelativityOne, has become the fastest-growing product in the company's history and we have consistently been named a great workplace. As we grow, we continue to seek individuals that will bring their whole, authentic self to our team.
Join us in the transformation of the legal industry and play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the practice of law and beyond. We don’t believe in ‘ideal’ candidates, so if you see a job that sparks your interest, go for it. Wherever you’re from, however you identify, and whatever experience you have, you can belong at Relativity.

The Storage Vertical:
The Storage Vertical is a critical portion of Service Delivery, providing Relativity with all of its storage needs. It abstracts away infrastructure management and provides operations with mechanisms by which underlying storage infrastructure is built, operated, vended, and consumed.

As a software engineer, you will be responsible for participating in and exercising ownership over the full software lifecycle of the unstructured storage offering. You will contribute to optimizing and refining the existing service, maintaining its operational state, adopting design and development best practices, and working with senior engineers to implement new features. You will work on our storage abstraction layer, data plane, as well as the control plane that manages these in order to deliver petabyte-scale, cloud-native storage solutions for Relativity.
Responsibilities:
Solve complex storage problems and implement their solutions using cloud native patterns and services
Adopt and exercise best practices in developing and delivering software, including test-driven and trunk-based development, as well as continuous integration and deployment
Contribute to the product through our development workflow
Triage customer requests and troubleshoot incidents when on-call
Effectively communicate with team members and stakeholders
Identify opportunities for improvement across the stack and promote their solutions
Maintain a high bar for code and architectural quality
Minimum Qualifications:

Senior Software Engineer, Ruby

You'll be joining a hardworking and capable team of backend engineers building the APIs at the heart of our customers' experience. You will be especially passionate about improving our customers' security, working on streamlining our existing APIs and developing new security products.

You will find yourself proposing, building, and documenting Ruby-based APIs, reviewing your peers' proposals and code, and growing as an engineer and as a contributor to our codebase and culture. You'll support, and be supported by, the members and leads of the broader Application Engineering team.

When you close your laptop at the end of the day, you will smile at the impact you had. Today, you were a part of keeping the internet reliable, fast, and secure.

What You'll Do
Work collaboratively with customer support, solutions, product, and sales teams to make tomorrow's customer experience even more secure and intuitive than today's
Take ownership of security features from start to finish, facilitating review and discussion with peers and partners, and ensuring features as implemented meet product requirements
Work in close partnership with your engineering leaders to build out and execute on everything from project design to engineering standards
Clearly communicate upward and outward to set and adjust expectations with your manager and partners
Make your support available to your team when and where they need it — a time zone compatible with the continental US, where your team will be, is a must for this role
Periodically travel (eventually, we hope!) to off-site engineering gatherings. Team bonding is important to us, and we love to discuss everything from roadmaps to culture and engineering management practice.
What We're Looking For
A history designing secure and user-friendly APIs
Experience building security-focused products
Experience writing elegant and maintainable Ruby code
A passion for learning, and sharing what you've learned with others
We value a variety of voices, so this is not a laundry list. You'll be a good candidate if you have experience in SOME of these:
Rust development
JavaScript development
TLS
Web Application Firewalls
Rate Limiting
DDoS mitigation

You'll be joining a hardworking and capable team of backend engineers building the APIs at the heart of our customers' experience. You will be especially passionate about improving our customers' security, working on streamlining our existing APIs and developing new security products.

You will find yourself proposing, building, and documenting Ruby-based APIs, reviewing your peers' proposals and code, and growing as an engineer and as a contributor to our codebase and culture. You'll support, and be supported by, the members and leads of the broader Application Engineering team.

When you close your laptop at the end of the day, you will smile at the impact you had. Today, you were a part of keeping the internet reliable, fast, and secure.

What You'll Do
Work collaboratively with customer support, solutions, product, and sales teams to make tomorrow's customer experience even more secure and intuitive than today's
Take ownership of security features from start to finish, facilitating review and discussion with peers and partners, and ensuring features as implemented meet product requirements
Work in close partnership with your engineering leaders to build out and execute on everything from project design to engineering standards
Clearly communicate upward and outward to set and adjust expectations with your manager and partners
Make your support available to your team when and where they need it — a time zone compatible with the continental US, where your team will be, is a must for this role
Periodically travel (eventually, we hope!) to off-site engineering gatherings. Team bonding is important to us, and we love to discuss everything from roadmaps to culture and engineering management practice.
What We're Looking For
A history designing secure and user-friendly APIs
Experience building security-focused products
Experience writing elegant and maintainable Ruby code
A passion for learning, and sharing what you've learned with others
We value a variety of voices, so this is not a laundry list. You'll be a good candidate if you have experience in SOME of these:
Rust development
JavaScript development
TLS
Web Application Firewalls
Rate Limiting
DDoS mitigation
Partnering with a Security Operations Center

ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of lithography systems that help enable Moore’s Law and the creation of increasingly powerful and capable electronic devices. Our San Diego-based light source division, Cymer, is renowned for developing both deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography light sources and next generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources.As the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, ASML enables chipmakers to produce cheaper, speedier chips – and to produce them faster – thereby enabling all the technology you use today. The systems we produce integrate several large and sophisticated machines, themselves each a feat of engineering innovation, precision, and speed.

We are a multinational company with over 70 locations in 16 countries, headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. We have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA (EUV laser source creation).

In the Cymer Light Source (CLS) division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic “consumer” laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require: durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing.
