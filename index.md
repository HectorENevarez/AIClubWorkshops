- **Main Function:** \_\_name__ == "\_\_main__", creating main function

# Workshop 3 (Data Science 1)
Our goal with this 3 part workshop is to create a tool that can estimate software engineer salaries. The main purpose of this 3 part workshop is to develop and understand the different roles involved in a typical data science job.

### Cleaning data
- Data collection and data cleaning are said to be the most important and time consuming parts of a data scientists role
- in this workshop we will be going over how to clean the data
- The data was previously collected so we can easily use it for this project

If you are interested in the scripts I used to collect the data [Click Here](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/tree/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection) but we won't be going over that in this workshop

### Let's get started with the workshop!
This workshop is broken down into two parts
- [Part 1](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop3/pandas_tutorial): For this first part we will go into a very introductory tutorial on pandas that will prepare us enough to begin cleaning our data
- [Part 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T9qbWtNIG-AwLoF4Uwbp9EoNwLSP9Vlu?usp=sharing): In this part we will be coding from scratch how to clean the data

### Resources Used
- Pandas
- [GlassDoor data](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection/glassdoor_job.csv) Make sure to download the data so we can use it for our workshop
- [Reference Sheet](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop3/reference) This reference sheet goes over all the pandas functions we used in depth for better understanding during the workshop

### Code used in the workshop
- [Data Cleaning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jomd9YD5EFm4IEM7wD_HQieZtDIXuFnF?usp=sharing): This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop

# Workshop 4 (Data Science 2)
This is the second part of our data science multi-week workshop. In this workshop we will be going over how to plot our data and analyze for our model building
### Exploratory Data Analaysis
- We will analyze our data for better understanding of the features and their correlation
- We will use our previously cleaned data for this workshop

### Resources Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- [Cleaned Data](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/Salary_Data_Cleaned.csv)

### Let's get Started with the workshop!
- [Numpy](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop4/plt_sns_tut#Numpy) First we're going to go over the numpy library to become familiar with numpy arrays
- [Matplotlib](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop4/plt_sns_tut#Matplotlib) Next, we'll go over matplotlibs pyplot module in order to develop an understanding for how we'll use our data to perform exploratory data anlysis
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PH5IKXM3pYrjTFtdT-BQblCCsozVbiPn?usp=sharing) Finally we will analyze our data using both numpy and matplotlib in order to create graphs that will help us understand relationships between our data

### Code Used in this workshop
- [Explortatory Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jnv9y4Vi2tIEvQclH2K6JHBMYJrf8FRh?usp=sharing): This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop

# Workshop 5 (Data Science 3)
This is the third and final part to the data science multi-week project. In this workshop we will do create the train and test the models
### Model Building
- We will use the features we decided on in our EDA and create models that will predict how much someone will get payed based on job listing
- The machine learning models we'll use are Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest
 
### Resources used
 - Pandas
 - Sklearn
 - Pickly
 - [Reference Sheet](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop5/reference)
 
### Let's get started with the workshop
 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
 - [Support Vector Regressor](google.com)
 - [Random Forest](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k7ZIhzCLB-C0TVyiBadRUIlthqWuctoAV3BWcTUBtbQ/edit?usp=sharing)
 
### Code Used in this workshop
 - [Model Building](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-I8pxFQLq1IfOKyKOvHQpGH09rZ4saYv?usp=sharing): This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop

# Workshop 6 (Computer Vision 1)
This is the first part of a 3 week-long computer vision workshop. In this workshop we will go over the basics of using opencv for image processing.
### Opencv basic tutorial
In this workshop we will be going over the basic functions of opencv
- [Opencv Workshop](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop6/opencv_tut)

### Resources used
- Opencv
- imutils
- matplotlib
- [Tetris Image](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/Workshop6-Opencv/tetris_blocks.png)
- [Reference Sheet](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop6/Reference)

### Beginner opencv tutorial summary:
- Loading images
- Cropping images
- resizing images
- rotating images
- **Drawing on images:** rectangle, circle, line, and text

### Activity
- In this activity we will be detecting objects on an image through the use of various built in opencv functions
- [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com) to be taken to google colab in order to get started

### Code Used
- [Object Detection](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshops/Workshop6/object_detection) This is the script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop
