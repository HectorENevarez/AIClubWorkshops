#### Beginner Python tutorial summary:
- **modules:** Importing modules, giving modules an alias usnig "as"
- **Functions:** defining a functions, arguements and parameters, arbitrary arguements, returning values

# Workshop 3
## cleaning data
- Data collection and data cleaning are said to be the most important and time consuming parts of a data scientists role
- in this workshop we will be going over how to clean the data
- The data was previously collected so we can easily use it for this project

If you are interested in the scripts I used to clean the data [Click Here](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/tree/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection) but we won't be going over that in this workshop
### Resources Used
- Pandas
- [GlassDoor data](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection/glassdoor_job.csv) Make sure to download the data so we can use it for our workshop

### Let's get started with the workshop!
This workshop is broken down into two parts
- [Part 1](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/Pandas-Tutorial.ipynb) For this first part we will go into a very introductory tutorial on pandas that will prepare us enough to begin cleaning our data
- [Part 2](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo-iceid4vl/lab) In this part we will be coding from scratch how to clean the data

### Code used in the workshop
- [data cleaning](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-cleaning.py) This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop

# Workshop 4
This is the second part of our data science multi-week workshop. In this workshop we will be going over how to plot our data and analyze for our model building
## Exploratory Data Analaysis
- We will analyze our data for better understanding of the features and their correlation
- We will use our previously cleaned data for this workshop

### Resources Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- [Cleaned Data](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/Salary_Data_Cleaned.csv)

### Let's get Started with the workshop!
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)

### code Used in this workshop
- [Explortatory Data Analysis](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/Workshop4-EDA/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb) This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop

# Workshop 5
This is the third and final part to the data science multi-week project. In this workshop we will do create the train and test the models
## Model Building
- We will use the features we decided on in our EDA and create models that will predict how much someone will get payed based on job listing
- The machine learning models we'll use are Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest
 
 ### Resources used
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Numpy
 - Sklearn
 
 ### Let's get started with the workshop
 - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)
 - [Linear Regression](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OE7mU9YThVaxI2YEwmZIL_7L9zrPfVJuMC2NchNdzqw/edit?usp=sharing)
 - [Lasso Regression](google.com)
 - [Random Forest](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k7ZIhzCLB-C0TVyiBadRUIlthqWuctoAV3BWcTUBtbQ/edit?usp=sharing)
 ### Code Used in this workshop
 - [Model Building](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/Workshop5-ModelBuilding/ModelBuilding.ipynb) This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop
