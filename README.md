# Workshop 3
## cleaning data
- Data collection and data cleaning are said to be the most important and time consuming parts of a data scientists role
- in this workshop we will be going over how to clean the data
- I previously collected the data

If you are interested in the scripts I used to clean the data [Click Here](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/tree/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection) but we won't be going over that in this workshop
### Resources Used
- Pandas
- [GlassDoor data](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-collection/glassdoor_job.csv) Make sure to download the data so we can use it for our workshop

### Let's get started with the workshop!
This workshop is broken down into two parts
- [Part 1](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/Pandas-Tutorial.ipynb) For this first part we will go into a very introductory tutorial on pandas that will prepare us enough to begin cleaning our data
- [Part 2](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo-iceid4vl/lab) In this part we will be coding from scratch how to clean the data

### Code used in the workshop
- [data cleaning](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/AIClubWorkshops/blob/master/workshop3-cleaningData/data-cleaning.py)This will take you to the python script we coded during this workshop just incase you need to look over it after the workshop
